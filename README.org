** Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: overview
:END:
The Behave fire modeling system is used to predict fire behavior in multiple situations.

Behave can be used for any fire management application that involves modeling fire behavior and some fire effects.

The system is composed of a collection of mathematical models that describe fire behavior and the fire environment.

Behave is a point system that calculates fire behavior for an area (or point) with homogeneous fuels. The program simulates rate of fire spread, spotting distance, scorch height, tree mortality, fuel moisture, wind adjustment factor, as well as other variables.
